To read and write in terms of bytes we have multiple classes:
- FileInputStream : Using this we can read from a file in terms of bytes
- FileOutputStream : Using this we can write to a file in terms of bytes
- FileReader : Using this we can read from a file in terms of characters
- FileWriter : Using this we can write to a file in terms of characters

- BufferedInputStream : Using this we can read from a buffer in terms of bytes
- BufferedOutputStream : Using this we can write to a buffer in terms of bytes
- BufferedReader : Using this we can read from a buffer in terms of characters
- BufferedWriter : Using this we can write to a buffer in terms of characters


- ObjectInputStream : Using this class we can read an object in terms of bytes
- ObjectOutputStream : Using this class we can write an object in terms of bytes
